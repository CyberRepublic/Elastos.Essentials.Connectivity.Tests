Write a simple ionic web client that imports the elastos connectivity SDK, the essentials
connector and deals with local identity and essentials identity sign in, hive, payments, contracts, etc.

This client should have 2 modes:
- Full mode (priority 1), to be used with a server. In this case, QR codes are used only to initiate a link to essentials, and scanned only once.
- Serverless mode (priority 2), to be used without a server (in this case, a qr code must be scaned every time an operation requires user's wallet interaction).
